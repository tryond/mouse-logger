# Mouse Logger

Mouse Logger is a desktop application which captures mouse movements and logs them to an online database.

## Description

Mouse Logger is an application developed to capture a single user's mouse behavior. The application is meant to run in the background while the user goes about his or her day-to-day activity. 

## Motivation

Mouse Logger is being developed alongside a suite of human-computer interaction research modules funded by Ore Technical Labs. All mouse strokes captured during any given session are uploaded to a database for analysis. The data captured is logged in an online database for use with our supplementary behavioral analysis tools.

## Instructions

### Download

Download 'mouse-logger.jar' release found [here](https://github.com/tryond/mouse-logger/releases).

### Login/Register

Mouse Logger requires that the user is logged in to ensure that the behavior collected is mapped to the correct user. If you are a first time user, please register with the application.

**Please do not change users during a single session. Log out and log back in as another user.** :+1:
